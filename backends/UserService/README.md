### User Service

This is our backend application in the `backends/UserService` folder. This app uses [apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and is implemented with [apollo federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/).

You can start this app by navigating to `backends/UserService` then `yarn install` and `yarn start`
