    title: 'My first post',
    body: `It was always Amrak’s job to deal with the birds afterwards, and he had always hated it. Every Temple day after the service he would have to wait for the worshippers to leave, then hang around while Father and the other priests finished up. As soon as they were gone the work began – mopping up the spilt blood, gathering the dirty robes into a basket to take outside to the waiting washerwomen, piling up the silver bowls to carry to the kitchen to be cleaned. Amrak had asked his father many times if he could rather wash the bowls, sweep the step outside, clean out the censers – anything but gather the broken bodies of the doves, but his request was always refused. “Do what I tell you, son,” Father always said. “No questions.”

    But Amrak had questions; he always had. Even though his curiosity had been soundly discouraged and he had mostly stopped asking, he had not lost it. He wanted to know why the poor birds had to die, their throats slit over the silver bowls before the blood was poured over the heads of the people during cleansings, weddings and dedications. He had experienced it himself during his cleansing ceremony when he had turned thirteen, like every other boy in Kalathan. Blood to sully, blood to purge. Blood to defile, blood to cleanse. He remembered it as if it was yesterday, even though it was already four years ago. He had been shocked that day by how warm the blood had been, and glad that as it had flowed over his face it had hidden his tears. 
    
    “You’re too sensitive, Amrak,” said his friend Mishik, walking past him with his polishing cloth as he crouched down over the pile of little bodies on the floor. “They’re just birds.”
    
    “Just birds,” Amrak repeated softly, picking one up by a wing. They were always cold by the time the service ended and he had to begin his work. He placed it gently into the sack he had brought, then picked up the next one. There had been five coming-of-age cleansings today, and two devilclaw purgings and a wedding the day before. Two doves for each, which meant sixteen little creatures lying dead on the tiled floor, sixteen still hearts in the sack, ready for the rubbish pile and then the fire. When he was done he placed the sack out of the way, fetched the broom to sweep up the feathers, then picked up the mop which stood against the wooden bucket. It only took ten minutes, to restore the floor to its previous shine, for the water in the bucket to turn from clear to gritty, muddy brown with the blood and droppings. 
    
    “Almost done,” said Mishik, as he put down the bronze censer he had just polished and picked up the last one. “All ready to carry next week’s prayers up to heaven!”
    
    “If the blood cleanses us,” Amrak said, half to Mishik, half to himself as he straightened his back, “then where do the sins go?”
    
    “What?” Mishik shook his head. “They don't go anywhere. The blood … dissolves them.”
    
    “Then the sins are still in the blood,” said Amrak. “They flow into the drains, then into the river. The river, and the sea, must be teeming with sins by now.”
    
    “No, no,” Mishik said. “Lands, you have strange thoughts, Amrak! You’ve got it all wrong. It’s a spiritual thing.”
    
    “If it’s spiritual, why do we need the blood then? Can't we just ask God to cleanse us, without breeding birds that we only kill?”
    
    Mishik replaced the last censer, balling up the dirty cloth. “Wait for next year when we begin our training,” he said. “You can ask the fatirs about that. I don't know enough to answer you.”
    
    Amrak picked up the bucket and broom, Mishik the mop. The two boys made their way towards the kitchen behind the building. “Are you excited about it?” Amrak asked. 
    
    “About what?” 
    
    “The training. All of it. Becoming a priest.”
    
    Mishik looked confused. “Not really. It’s going to be hard work. But it’s a good living and I don't know what else I would do.”
    
    “I don't mind hard work,” said Amrak. 
    
    “But?” Mishik peered at him as they set down their burdens and faced each other. 
    
    “I don't want to shave my head. And I'm not sure I want to be a priest at all.” It felt almost dangerous to say it. 
    
    Mishik gave a low whistle. “I want to be there when you tell that to your father,” he said. “Really, Amrak. How many generations of your family have been priests? I doubt you could even count!”
    
    Amrak didn't answer. It was laughable, he had to agree, to think that he could choose another path for his life. His father was so proud of their family, proud of his position, proud to be a Kalathene, most of all proud to be a priest of the Temple. He walked around the town in his long red robe, his shaved head held high, proud of his dutiful wife, his obedient sons, his devout, co-operative daughters. He didn't know that Amrak shuddered every time a bird was killed, every time he smelled the incense, every time he heard the chanting. He didn't know that his son’s favourite day of the week was the day after Temple day, because it meant there were six whole days until the next one. He didn't know that when his son closed his eyes to chant the prayers, he felt nothing, that when he looked up at the great curly spire of the Temple looming above the City he found himself daydreaming about what life would be like if it was not there at all. 
    
    He and Mishik removed their aprons and washed their hands, then exited the back door of the Temple into the alley, Amrak carrying the sack. It had snowed earlier, and now the wind blew flurries of it up and down the alley. 
    
    “Well, see you tomorrow I suppose,” Mishik said, pulling on his gloves and shoving his hat as far down on his head as he could. “Can you believe it’s our last week of school?”
    
    “Training will be worse than school,” Amrak said, as he turned up the collar of his thick fur-edged coat against the cold wind and wrapped his scarf around his head. 
    
    “Yes, but we will be studying with the men, not the boys!” Mishik said. “Will you shave your head soon? My father says it’s better to do it now rather than just before we begin.”
    
    “Probably,” Amrak said. Father had said, that morning, that he thought they should do it tonight.
    
    The boys parted, Mishik heading back to his home for dinner, Amrak heading in the opposite direction to take the sack, as he always did, to one of the wagon beds that was always parked in the same place near the Temple. He would fling the sack onto the pile of whatever waste was already there, and in the morning someone would arrive to haul the load off to the furnaces outside the City. The little birds would fly away then, he supposed, as the ash rose into the sky. 
    
    When he was finally free of the sack he turned around, thinking about the meal that waited for him at home, keeping warm by the stove. Another Temple day done. 
    
    He heard a noise then, a clattering as if something had fallen off the wagon. He turned around, startled. He had thought that he was alone in the alley. He crouched down to see if he could see if anything lay on the ground, and saw a flash of movement. 
    
    “Hey!” he called. “Who’s there?”
    
    No answer. He stepped closer. “Who’s there?”
    
    “No one!” called a voice. A boy’s voice, clear and confident. 
    
    Amrak stood still, unsure whether to laugh or be insulted. “What are you doing?” he asked. “That’s just rubbish in there!”
    
    He stared for a moment at the wagon. Nothing moved. Then suddenly there was another crashing sound, and the boy stepped out from behind the wagon, holding up Amrak’s sack. He was small, at least a head shorter than Amrak, a good few years younger.
    
    “Hey!” he said again. “That’s my sack!”
    
    “You threw it away,” said the boy, shrugging. He looked cold, Amrak thought, his coat thin and unlined, only a too-big woolen hat on his head. His boots looked ancient, the tops peeling away from the soles. “So you clearly don't want it!”
    
    Amrak stood still, wondering how to answer.
    
    “Rubbish to you, dinner to me!” said the boy. 
    
    “But you can’t eat those!” Amrak was appalled.
    
    “Oh, I can!” said the boy. “It’s quite easy. I pull out the feathers, cut out the insides and roast them. They’re not more than a few bites each but I’m not complaining.” Was he laughing? He had a wide grin, scruffy dark hair, and a rather blue face. 
    
    “But … those are Temple birds,” Amrak said. 
    
    The boy shrugged again. “Either they get roasted in the furnace and turned to black for nothing, my friend, or they serve a greater purpose by feeding me and my friends.”
    
    Amrak took a few steps closer, wondering if the boy would run away. “Do you do this … often?”
    
    “Most Temple days. I watch for you whenever you come out of that door. I’ve grown fond of your face lately, to be honest. You represent meat, glorious meat!” The boy held out his arms, the sack swinging wildly from one hand, and grinned widely. 
    
    Amrak could not help it. He smiled back. 
    
    An hour later, Amrak was sitting on an upturned wooden crate in another alley, warming his hands over the little fire the boy had made in a half-broken old brazier. He knew his parents would be wondering where he was, but he pushed that thought aside and hoped they would just think he had gone to Mishik’s house as he had once or twice before. He did not quite understand why he had not just turned around and left, why he had found himself asking the boy’s name and then following him here. It had been an impulse, he thought, as he watched him pluck out feathers and hack at the doves’ chests with a blunt-looking knife, something rebellious, and in the moment he had wanted nothing more than to do something different, to follow this odd boy off into the cold to watch him turn the bodies of the sacrificial doves into his lunch. His name was Kashrik, it turned out, and he was thirteen.  
    
    “Don’t you have a home?” Amrak asked. 
    
    Kashrik shrugged. “Not really,” he said. 
    
    “Why not?”
    
    Kashrik looked up from his hacking. “You work at the Temple, don't you?”
    
    “My father is a priest,” Amrak said. 
    
    “So you will be too?”
    
    Amrak looked down. “That’s the plan.”
    
    “Then I can’t tell you why.”
    
    “What’s being a priest got to do with why you don't have a home?”
    
    “If I tell you, you might haul me off to your father. Instead of dove meat in my stomach, I’ll have dove blood on my head.”
    
    “Oh,” Amrak said, starting to understand. “You’re …” He could not say it. 
    
    The boy put down his knife and pulled up his left sleeve. “There you go,” he said, showing Amrak the inked mark on the inside of his wrist. “I’m a devilclaw. I had a home but my father kicked me out last year. Sometimes I go to the back door and my mother gives me some bread, but most of the time I fend for myself.”
    
    “Where do you sleep?”
    
    Kashrik looked at him sideways. “Somewhere warm. There are people in the City who do not share the Temple’s opinion of people like me. Kind people. I haven’t frozen yet.”
    
    Amrak took a breath, then blew it out again, watching as it condensed into mist in front of him. The boy picked up the knife again, with his left hand of course. Amrak wondered how he had not noticed it before. The Devil’s Claw. This pleasant-faced friendly boy was cursed, according to the Temple, an anomaly, a catalyst of bad luck. His left hand now, cutting away at the bird, looked so wrong, so strange, as if Amrak was watching himself in a mirror.
    
    “Sorry,” he said. It was all he could think of to say. “That’s terrible.”
    
    Kashrik laughed. “Don’t be sorry!” he said. “Sympathising with me will bring you bad luck, remember. Eating with me …” He grimaced, then smiled. “Probably worse. Perhaps you will wake up tomorrow covered in leprosy.”
    
    He reached down to the ground to pick up a blackened sharp stick which he thrust through the bloody little body of the dove, then handed it to Amrak. “You hold it over the fire,” he said, “while I do the others.”
    
    He looked up, the smile on his face so artless and genuine that Amrak did not know what to say. The flames leapt up, singeing the meat, the smell that rose up into the air surprisingly pleasant. 
    
    “I don't want to be a priest,” he said, partly to Kashrik, partly to himself. “I hate the Temple.”
    
    Kashrik looked up in surprise.
    
    “I hate the blood and the chanting, all of it. I love my father but I can't think of any other priest that I trust. I want to be a soldier or a farmer or a blacksmith – anything but a priest.”
    
    He had never said anything like that before. He had barely even let himself think it. 
    
    “Well, I don't blame you,” Kashrik said. “I’d rather be a devilclaw than spend my life serving a God who doesn't care about anyone but himself, if he’s even there at all.”
    
    Amrak, feeling quite breathless after his confession, did not answer. So there were people in Kalathan who did not live in the shadow of the Temple. There were people who cared enough about devilclaws to give them a place to sleep, people who were not afraid of the curse. The thought gave him courage, as the knowledge of what he had to do began to settle. He lifted his hand to his neck to touch the thick brown hair that reached to his collar. He would not be sitting down by the fire tonight while Father sharpened the razor. He would find his own path, and what Kashrik had just told him gave him hope that he would not be alone. 
    
    While Kashrik plucked and cut, the little pile of smelly entrails on the street beside him growing steadily, Amrak held the sticks, turning them gently, making sure the meat cooked evenly. And when Kashrik announced that the first bird had cooked long enough, took out a little twist of paper from his pocket and sprinkled the blackened shape with salt, Amrak lifted what had once been a fluttering bird up to his face and breathed in the aroma. 
    
    “Enjoy!” Kashrik said, holding up his own bird, its legs splayed grotesquely off to each side. “To the lowly dove, cleanser of sins and filler of stomachs!” He took a great, ravenous bite, tearing off the meat, smiling widely through his chewing. 
    
    Amrak smiled back, took a breath, and ate. `,

    title: 'My Second post',
    body: `The orange sun peeked from behind the empty hills and found two sets of furrowed brows. On the driver seat, Michael lowered the sun visor, and his frown dissolved. On the passenger seat, his son did the same, and his frown didn’t move. Kevin’s eyes were lost beyond the hills, his arms crossed, his hands fiddling with the cord of the headphones.

    “I hate this time of day,” Michael said.
    
    There was no response from the passenger seat.
    
    The orange hangover sun was flooding the dashboard. The hills came and went lazily on the horizon. They said hi and goodbye and kept going, slowly, on an infinite dance up and down, like sound waves.
    
    Michael sipped from a large coffee to go and pushed the oversized cup back into the small cup holder, struggling to make it fit.
    
    “The sunrise, I mean,” he tried again.
    
    Kevin kept his eyes on the hills. The car was silent except for the droning of the wheels. Michael prayed for the radio to come back to life. He should have fixed it months ago but he never really listened to the radio. He enjoyed having the silence as his passenger. There had been enough opportunities to get the radio fixed, but they had come and gone, and it was still broken. Now he realized this had been a mistake.
    
    He pushed the buttons on the radio, hoping it would magically start playing a song or the news. God, he hated the radio news, but even that would be better than this silence, better than the hum of the tires on the road, singing the most tedious song in the history of humanity. White noise, static from the dead radio. The screaming sound of having nothing to say.
    
    “Why?” Kevin asked.
    
    “What’s that?”
    
    Kevin sighed. “Why do you hate the sunrise?”
    
    “Oh,” Michael gathered his thoughts and answered. “Bad memories.”
    
    The humming kept strong, the blaring of nothingness. He could hear the granularity of the asphalt in the sound, feel the silence vibrating in his chest.
    
    “From when I was just a bit older than you are,” he said. “I used to go out. To parties, that is. In my twenties. And get drunk.”
    
    A new patch of asphalt came in the distance and found the wheels with a different texture of sound, as bland as the one before.
    
    “The time to end a fun night is before sunrise,” Michael said. “If you started drinking the night before and you’re still drinking the next morning, you’re doing it wrong. When the hot sun touches your face in the morning, it’s like you’re getting licked by a dog that’s just licked itself. It’s warm and disgusting. You feel like trash. You’re thirsty, and you’re hungry, and you just want to go to bed and sleep in your clothes, which are all sticky from people bumping on you all night and spilling beer.”
    
    He sipped the coffee while the hills came and went. Hi, they said over the static of the silent radio. Then, goodbye. And the dull humming proceeded.
    
    “God, getting drunk sucks.”
    
    “Michael, that’s lame.” Kevin’s frown was directed at his father now. The furrowed brows were the same Michael could see on his bathroom mirror every morning.
    
    “What?”
    
    “This little rant of yours is a lame attempt at keeping me away from drinking,” Kevin said.
    
    “Wha- No! Not at all.”
    
    “Right.” A smirk and back to the frown.
    
    The drab droning kept unaltered except for the changes of the asphalt. A different shade of white noise here and there, a new radio station playing a new song, as monotonous and hypnotic as the one before.
    
    “I mean, you shouldn’t drink,” Michael said. “Well, you can. You’re going to college. God knows you will. I’m just saying, don’t drink too much. It’s bad. At least in my experience.”
    
    Kevin’s eyes were on the horizon again, riding the empty sound waves of the traveling hills. Hi. Goodbye. Up and down.
    
    Michael took another sip from the coffee, another struggle to make the cup fit.
    
    “Well, do you even drink?”
    
    “I’m seventeen,” Kevin said.
    
    “Seventeen. Right.”
    
    Kevin raised the sun visor. The sun had already thanked the hills for letting it crash on their couch and was now on its journey through the vivid blue sky. Michael raised his sun visor as well.
    
    “And what about that old friend of yours? Do you go out with him?”
    
    “I don’t go out. I spend most of my free time on the computer.”
    
    “Yeah, but do you talk to him?”
    
    “Who?”
    
    “That friend of yours,” Michael said. “The one from school.”
    
    “There were at least two hundred kids at my school.”
    
    “Jesus, seriously? I mean the small kid. The one with the glasses. I think his name was Timmy.”
    
    “You mean Tommy,” Kevin said. “Michael, that was in third grade.”
    
    The static sang its dull song in Michael’s ears. “Third grade. Right.”
    
    He tried another sip but there was no more coffee in the wrinkled cup.
    
    “Hey,” Michael said, “do you remember grandpa's and grandma’s lake house? We used to go there when you were young.”
    
    “Yeah. I guess.”
    
    “It’s only a half-an-hour drive from your college. We should go there sometime and hang out. I still go there every couple of weeks or so, to take a look if everything is in order. The place is kind of abandoned since your grandpa died. So I go up there, clean up, and just hang out for a while, drink a beer with my feet in the lake. It’s peaceful. Silent. It’s nice.”
    
    Michael waited but there was no answer from Kevin. There was just the never-ending droning of the wheels.
    
    “Do you remember the swing on the yard?” he insisted. “It’s still there. God, you used to love that swing! You kept asking me to push you higher and higher and I would do it and you’d never get afraid. Your mom was so pissed! She would say I wasn’t careful with you, that I was a bad… father.”
    
    “So you go to the lake house every couple of weeks and just hang out?”
    
    “Yeah!”
    
    “So how come you never come to visit?”
    
    Michael’s heart was as wrinkled as his coffee cup, pressed against the tight walls of his chest. There was a surge of pain and nausea, but he kept his eyes fixed on the road and his face as blank as the song in the silent radio.
    
    Kevin’s eyes were lost on the hills again, and Michael’s mind was drowning in the sound of the dull sound.
    
    “You didn’t have to do this, you know?” Kevin said.
    
    “What?”
    
    “Give me a ride. You didn’t have to.”
    
    “Yeah, well, your mom had a shift at the hospital.”
    
    “I know,” Kevin said, his eyes had now left the hills and were on the screen of his phone, his right hand flipping through a list of songs while the left hand untangled his headphones. “But Bob could’ve taken me.”
    
    Another moment of deafening silence. Another sip from the empty cup. Another shade of white noise.
    
    “Yeah, no,” Michael said. “I wanted to. When was the last time we’ve spent time together?”
    
    “I don’t know,” Kevin said, putting on his headphones. “I don’t remember.”
    
    Michael looked at the horizon, at the up and down of the hills. “Right.” Hi. Goodbye. “I don’t remember either.”
    
    The hills came and went, and then there were only plains of cornfields. And then buildings, and a town, and another. But there was no silence.
    
    #
    
    “Do you need a hand with that?”
    
    “No, I got it.”
    
    Kevin took the microwave from the trunk. He was carrying a backpack, and another bag was strapped across his chest. Michael closed the trunk of the car and pulled up the handle of the wheeled suitcase. They walked to the brick residence hall and he biped the car in the distance.
    
    “Let me get that for you,” Michael said, rushing for the glass door.
    
    “No need to.” Kevin pushed the door with his back.
    
    He let the door go and Michael held it with his foot.
    
    They walked to the stairs, their steps echoing through the empty hall.
    
    “Are you sure you don’t need any help?”
    
    “I’m sure.”
    
    They crawled upstairs, one step at a time. Kevin leading the way, Michael following, on and on up the endless staircase.
    
    “Do you know where it is?” Michael asked when they got to the second floor.
    
    “Yeah, it should be at the end of this hallway.”
    
    “And you’ve got the key?”
    
    “Yup.”
    
    Michael followed Kevin through the hallway, the doors all closed, the walls empty, the fluorescent lights buzzing above their heads, a lonely window in the end wall.
    
    Kevin stopped in front of the last door and shifted the microwave on his arms.
    
    “Could you knock, please?”
    
    “This one?”
    
    “Yeah.”
    
    Michael settled the suitcase on the floor and raised his hand, but before he touched the door, it flung open. A kid with a headset on was standing inside.
    
    “May I help you?” the boy asked.
    
    Michael stared blankly.
    
    “Hey, Li,” Kevin said. “It’s me. Help me put this microwave somewhere.”
    
    He shouldered his way past Michael and into the room and rushed for a table to put the microwave.
    
    “Oh, hey, K.G.,” Li said, “you’re finally here!”
    
    Michael stood outside for a second and then stepped into the room, rolling the suitcase.
    
    “Where do you want me to…” He trailed off, his voice drowned by Li’s and Kevin’s greetings.
    
    “It’s nice to finally see you in person, bro,” Kevin told Li while they hugged.
    
    Michael looked around. Two beds, one empty, the other one with an open laptop. A small clothes cabinet, a lonely, worn-out desk with the microwave, a minifridge, a window overlooking the parking lot. On the wall above Li’s bed, there was a poster of what Michael assumed to be either a video-game or a movie.
    
    The phone rang in his pocket.
    
    “Hey, it’s your mom,” Michael said. “She probably wants to know if we got here in one piece. I’m gonna take this outside.”
    
    He left the suitcase where it was and stepped into the hallway, taking the phone to his ear.
    
    “Hey, Linda.”
    
    “Are you there yet?” the voice on the phone asked.
    
    “Well, hi to you too.”
    
    Inside the room, Li and Kevin were talking, and Michael’s ear turned the volume down on Linda.
    
    “We gotta find a place to plug that microwave,” Li said. “And who’s that guy? Your uncle?”
    
    “Nah, that’s Michael. He’s my absent father, trying to compensate for his absence I guess.”
    
    Michael’s eyes died in a stare as blank as the walls in the hallway. The only sound in his ears was his heart pumping, and in between pumps, the buzz of the fluorescent lights. The dead radio was still playing the white noise song, but it had been thrown underwater, the static distorted into a low frequency. His chest hurt with every beat of his heart and so did his ears, and he couldn’t turn that damn radio off.
    
    From far away came a voice on the radio.
    
    “Hello? Michael, are you there? Michael, answer me! Hello?”
    
    He blinked a hundred times and shook his head.
    
    “Yeah, yeah. Yes! I’m here.”
    
    He walked to the stairs. He needed air.
    
    “What happened?” Linda asked.
    
    “Sorry, I zoned out for a second. What was the question?”
    
    He could hear her rolling her eyes in the brief silence of the phone.
    
    “Are you there yet? Did you get there fine?”
    
    “Yes. We’re here.” He tried pushing the glass door a couple of times before pulling it open. “He’s settling in, his roommate is already there.”
    
    “Oh, he mentioned Li would be there,” Linda said. “Good.”
    
    “You already knew his roommate?”
    
    “Well, they’ve been talking online for a couple of weeks now.”
    
    “Right,” Michael said while he kicked a pebble in the parking lot. “Linda, listen. Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you tell him bad things about me through all these years?”
    
    “What? Michael, why would I? Of course not! What are you talking about?”
    
    “It’s just… that kid hates me.”
    
    Her sigh on the phone carried an emotion he didn’t want to take, but it was the only one she had to offer.
    
    “I’m sorry to hear that, Michael. I truly am. But you didn’t exactly help all these years.”
    
    “I know,” he said, “but I’m trying to help now and he won’t let me.”
    
    “I was talking about helping yourself.”
    
    “Right,” he kicked another pebble.
    
    “He is a grown man now, he doesn’t need your help. He doesn’t need a father now.”
    
    “Yeah. No, I know.”
    
    For a second there was nothing but silence and a cool breeze caressed Michael’s face.
    
    “But maybe he could have a friend?” he said.

    “Are you sure you didn’t forget anything?” Michael asked Kevin from inside the car, Li was standing at the glass door of the residence hall.
    
    “Yeah, I’m sure,” Kevin answered. “Thanks for the ride, Michael.”
    
    “Don’t mention it. I…” He fumbled for words but nothing came.
    
    The setting sun hit Kevin’s face the same way it had in the morning and he furrowed his brows to look at Michael. Everything was silent, and Michael’s crumpled up heart was hurting inside his tiny chest.
    
    “Listen, son. I… I know I haven’t been around much and the only thing I can tell you now is I’m sorry. I can’t go back in time. I can’t go back to when you were that kid I was pushing on the swing on the lake house. I can’t go back to the birthdays I missed, to the hospital when you broke your arm, to Disneyland when you met Pluto, to when you found out you had been accepted in college. I can’t pretend I’ve been a part of your life, and I have no excuses. I used to have them, I used to have a bunch of them. At first, it was weird because of the divorce. And then I moved out of town. And then there was Bob, and I missed a birthday because of that. And then I missed another and another, and it would be just too awkward to show up there out of the blue.
    
    “Life, it’s weird. It’s like a highway in some ways. You get an exit and if you miss it you sometimes have to drive for miles to get another one. And until you get to the next one you’re asking yourself ‘Why the hell didn’t I take the last one?’ And you hate yourself for not having taken it. And you have to keep driving and driving and asking and hating.
    
    “But I finally took the exit, and I’m here now. Because I kept driving and driving and at some point, I noticed I was driving by myself. My mistakes were my only passengers. I don’t want it to be this way anymore. I want to have a son! And you’re really unlucky because I do have a son, and it’s you. But it’s a son who doesn’t even know me. A son who doesn’t feel comfortable enough to call me dad. A son who hates me.”
    
    The lazy breeze swept the parking lot while a small tear washed Michael’s eyes.
    
    “That hurts,” his voice cracked. “That hurts so much, you have no idea. I want to change that. So, if you ever feel like having a beer with your old man, give me a call. I mean, you can’t drink but… you know. We can go to the lake house, you can bring Li with you. We can… go fishing. I’d have to talk to Li’s parents and I don’t even know if there are fish in that lake but, I mean… just call me. Ok?”
    
    Kevin’s frown had a twinge of sadness now.
    
    “Geez, Michael,” he said, “What am I supposed to say?”
    
    “I know, it was too much to drop on you. I’m sorry. I just had to take it out of my chest. So, just… you know.”
    
    He extended his arm and touched his son’s. Kevin awkwardly grabbed his father’s hand and Michael pressed it. A hug for hands. He enjoyed it for a second before bringing his hand back inside the car and turning on the engine.
    
    “Take care, son.”
    
    “Yeah, don’t worry.”
    
    “Bye, Li,” Michael shouted.
    
    “Bye, Mr. G,” Li waved back.

    Michael sat with a beer on the small dock of the lake house, his feet in the water, the big white moon reflecting off the lake. The crickets and the frogs were screaming in a constant buzz and the sound danced on the ripples of the lake. He took a sip from the beer and looked at his feet.
    
    His phone rang.
    
    “Hello?”
    
    “Hey, Michael,” Kevin said.
    
    “Hey! Did you forget something in the car?”
    
    “No, no. It’s just… I was thinking about what you’ve said, about having a beer with you. Li is very interested.”
    
    Michael laughed.
    
    “So, you know,” Kevin continued, “if you wanna pick us up next weekend, I think it could be fun.”
    
    “Yeah, sure buddy! I’m not sure about that beer though. And I’d have to talk to Li’s parents.”
    
    “Yeah, no problem. I think it could be fun anyway,” Kevin said.
    
    “Sure thing. I’ll pick you boys up next weekend.”
    
    “Cool! Thanks… dad. Bye.”
    
    Michael held the phone in his hand and kept looking at it for a few seconds with the stupidest smile. He slipped the phone back into his pocket and drank from the beer.
    
    There was not a single sound in the entire world, only the deepest of silences hovering over the moon-kissed lake. Michael floated on that sweet song.`,

    title: 'Bridgemoss Guardians',
    body: `She waited for 15 minutes after the sliver of light beneath her bedroom door disappeared. Once she was sure her parents were asleep, Sadie slid the window up and stole down the trellis. The autumnal air swished down into her lungs — crisp, chilly, and delicious. She landed like a cat, crouched, hands on the floor. Sadie didn’t need to jump the last of the way to the ground, but where would the fun be in not doing that?

    Her ten-speed leaned next to the bins — where she’d left it. With a glance up at the droopy eyes of the house, she hopped on her bike and cycled off into the night. After half a minute, she clicked her torch on and plopped it into the basket. The beam sliced through the evening’s ink.
    
    The streets were empty at this time of night, save for the high school kids. They drove around, windows obscured with pot smoke, beers in one hand, steering wheels in the other. Sadie didn’t bother to hide from these, but she did take caution to avoid collisions. If only her father — who grumbled about their poor driving skills — could see them now.
    
    It didn’t take her long to reach Lisa’s house. Google Maps told her it was an 11-minute journey, but she always raced to beat the time. She usually made it in seven minutes or less. Not that she had her phone with her now. Her parents had installed a tracking app a few months back. Sadie left the blasted thing plugged in on her nightstand. Should they check in the morning, it’d seem she’d slept the night through. It never occurred to them that their modern child would leave the house without it. As far as they were aware, they’d succeeded in their attempts to curb their daughter’s night time excursions.
    
    She flashed her light at Lisa’s window. On, off. On, off. On, off.
    
    First, nothing. Then, the curtains stirred and the window clunked open. Sadie caught wind of a sigh. The voice that whispered down to her was thick with drowsiness. “I thought you were joking about tonight, Sadie.”
    
    “I never joke about a hunt! Besides, your mom’s working the night shift tonight, is she not?”
    
    Lisa groaned. “Can’t we just sleep? I’m tired!”
    
    Sadie shone the light across Lisa’s form. “Evil never sleeps, Lisa!” Sadie grinned. Lisa had not yet gotten into her pink pyjamas. “Mr Moore has been found dead in his home!”
    
    “Really? Oh, God. Fine Just get that light outta my face, will ya? I’ll be down in a moment.”
    
    Sadie clicked the torch off and waited. After a spell, the front door of the Brown’s house opened and closed. Lisa wrapped her cardigan around her and shivered. “Mr Moore is dead?”
    
    “And a good evening to you too, my fellow protector!”
    
    “Sade?”
    
    “Well, not dead…”
    
    Lisa threw her head back and growled. “You always do this.”
    
    “But he did say that a bat tried to enter his home last night! A spectre of the macabre, I’ve no doubt. We should ensure the foul beast does not find any more prey.”
    
    Lisa watched her breath float away. “Why’d we have to go out again this week, Sade? We went out on Sunday.”
    
    Sadie sniffed the air. “Darkness lurks these streets, Lis. I can smell it.”
    
    “All I can smell is your bul—”
    
    Sadie silenced her with an upraised hand. “Quickly. My senses are tingling. We must head off the leech before he leaves his enclosure!”
    
    Lisa’s shoulders slumped. “Fine, but no more than an hour, yeah? It’s a school night.”
    
    Sadie nodded, hand over her heart. “Scout’s honour. You got the stake?”
    
    Lisa rolled her eyes. “Yes, Mom.” She patted her rucksack. “Don’t know why I’ve gotta be the one to store all this crap. If I get caught with it, people will think I’m a loony.”
    
    “‘Cos your mom doesn’t search your room, Lis. Now, hop on.”
    
    Lisa did as Sadie told her, but grumbled as she did so. “Maybe there’s a reason your parents search your room, Sade. You’re mental.”
    
    “If being labelled mental is the price I have to pay to ensure the safety of the citizens of Bridgemoss,” Sadie said as she began to pedal with a grunt, “then so be it!”
    
    Lisa took a deep breath. “You gotta grow up at some point, Sade. We’ll be in high school next year. We don’t wanna be labelled as the weird girls. Those chicks never get dates.”
    
    “And still you doubt my gifts! You should have learned by now that this world is darker and more mysterious than the grownups would have you believe.”
    
    “So you keep saying.”
    
    “Do you not remember The Wolf of St Wisnis?”
    
    “…that was a stray dog.”
    
    “Ah, but did we not help the pound in catching a most evasive beast?”
    
    “Yeah, all right. I’ll agree we did some good there. We helped a homeless dog find shelter. I think Katy’s family adopted him.”
    
    “And of the ghosts of West Wootbridge?”
    
    “You mean the broken windchimes that Mrs Andrews had in her porch? That sounded like wailing?”
    
    “And did we not put an end to such ghastly choruses?”
    
    “We stole them, fixed them, then hung ‘em up again.”
    
    Sadie sighed. “Ah, another citizen protected!”
    
    Lisa chuckled. “Absolutely mental. So, where is it we’re heading tonight? I don’t wanna go trudging through dirty streams full of broken glass and needles again. My mum’ll kill me if I wreck another pair of trainers.”
    
    “Tonight, my fellow protector, we must head the destroyer off before he even leaves his lair!”
    
    “Oh, Jesus. I hate the cemetery.”
    
    ***
    
    A thick mist clung to the ground. It seemed to seep from the very pores of the earth itself and offered the place a pale illumination. The tombstones pointed this way and that, drunkards who leaned against doorframes.
    
    The only sounds were their own ragged breaths and their footsteps as they squelched in the mud.
    
    “I don’t like this, Sade. It’s creepy.”
    
    “But have we not sworn an oath to brave the creeps of this world?”
    
    “An oath that you made up.”
    
    “An oath is an oath, my fellow guardian. Aren’t all oaths made up, at some point or another? At what point do they start to mean something?”
    
    Lisa hesitated. “Fair enough. But I still don’t like this.”
    
    Sadie turned to face her, a toothy grin on her face. “So you admit that there is something out here tonight? You feel it too!” She clenched a fist. “I knew under my tutelage you’d soon hone your senses.”
    
    Lisa pulled her cardigan ever higher around her chest — any further, and she’d risk ripping the damn thing. “I-I don’t know. But I know that if we get stabbed and mugged, my mom’ll be more pissed than upset. At first, anyway.”
    
    “We need not worry about being impaled by the drinker of life, it is he who should worry about us doing so to him!”
    
    Lisa frowned. “Sometimes, Sade, you get so wrapped up in your theatrics that you make no goddamn sense.”
    
    Sadie shrugged. “We gon’ stab the vampire.”
    
    “Much better. But, still, can we go home? This is creepy. And I legit don’t wanna get hurt.”
    
    Sadie pointed forward with the stake. “Hush, now!” The moss-covered stones — features softened by the weather — gave way to the maze of the vaults. “We draw near to the crypts, my sweet, poor, innocent, Lisa.”
    
    Narrow structures with ancient doors, each one of a different design. Pointed rooves adorned with all manner of crucifixes. Steps led up or down to the entrances — all smothered in decayed leaves, wet with moisture. Thin, barely-passable alleys wove between the stone tombs. The way ahead was impossible to see.
    
    “Oh, I hate this place,” said Lisa. Her voice rustled like the leaves beneath their feet. Low, quiet.
    
    “Fear not, young padawan, for I am here to guide you through tonight’s gauntlet.”
    
    Lisa stopped a few steps short of the labyrinth. “Ten minutes. That’s all you get, Sade. Ten minutes, and then we’re back out and heading home. Deal?”
    
    “But we only just got here!”
    
    “Sadie, this is insane. I wanna be back at home. In bed. With a hot chocolate. And a good book.”
    
    Sadie lamented. “All right, Lis. But if the winged bringer of doom takes another life—”
    
    “Mr Moore is still alive and kicking.”
    
    “—takes a life, then that blood shall be on our hands!”
    
    Lisa eyed the first row sepulchres and chewed her lip. “Ten minutes, Sade.”
    
    Sadie thrust the stake forward. “To the lair of der Vampir!”
    
    ***
    
    “Okay, Sade. You’ve had 13 minutes—”
    
    “An evil number, if I ever heard one. Let’s stay another minute.”
    
    They were deep in the crypts, had walked nonstop — ears pricked, eyes peeled. They’d not found anything out of place, much to Lisa’s prediction and to Sadie’s chagrin.
    
    “Sadie.” Lisa’s voice hardened. It startled Sadie. It was the type of tone her mother would use on her. They weren’t little kids any more, and her heart ached to see her childhood now in the rearview mirror.
    
    “All right, all right, let’s go. Here.” She handed Lisa the stake. “For safekeeping. Next time, you get to pick what we do.”
    
    Lisa smiled. “Thanks, Sade.”
    
    “But no chick-flicks!”
    
    “No, but no eighties horror movies that—” Lisa’s eyes darted to the point over Sadie’s shoulder. She frowned.
    
    Sadie snatched the stake from Lisa’s hands and twisted around. “En garde!” But there was no denizen of the night there.
    
    Only the faded stone of an ancient crypt.
    
    With the door open ajar.
    
    A foul breath gasped through the crack.
    
    “Aha! The beast has not hidden his abode well,” Sadie said, voice a whisper. She gripped the stake tighter, knuckles white, teeth visible in her moonlit grin.
    
    “Shh! Sadie, this is serious!” Lisa put a hand on her shoulder before she could take a step. “There could be graverobbers or anyone down there!”
    
    “I take my hunting very seriously, thank you, dear guardian.” Sadie pulled away and strode towards the black door. “And if they disturb the slumber of the beast, it could spell doom for us all!”
    
    An archway curled around the edges of the door, with slots for lanterns above and either side. The lanterns were present, but their innards were devoid of flame. Sadie paused at the foot of the steps, which ascended to the door. She read the name carved into the stone above the archway. “Loretta Zaleska,” she said in awe, “and here we were thinking that the vamp was a man.” Sadie tutted and shook her head. She looked at Lisa. “Not very progressive of us, was it?”
    
    “We’re not actually going down there. Are we? ‘Cos that’s trespassing. We could get arrested.”
    
    “We’d be doing the local law enforcement fools a favour — ridding them of one more vermin!”
    
    “I don’t think that’s how they’d see it, Sade. And I don’t want to get a criminal record before I’m halfway through my teens. My mum’ll make me wish I got stabbed by junkies if that happens.”
    
    “Just a quick peek, Lis.” Sadie offered her the puppy-dog eyes. “Please.”
    
    “No. I’m not going down there.”
    
    Sadie smiled at her. A smile that Lisa knew all too well. “I’ll be down just for a sec, Lis. You stay here.”
    
    “No, Sadie, wait—”
    
    But Sadie had already leapt up the steps and was at the door.
    
    Lisa loosed a noise of exasperation and then followed her friend. “I swear, you’re going to get me killed.” The wet leaves squelched and squidged beneath her converse.
    
    “You don’t have to join me, y’know.” Sadie had one hand on the door, the other held the stake in a Ramboesque pose. “I can defend Bridgemoss by my lonesome.”
    
    “Because somebody’s gotta make sure you don’t get yourself killed.”
    
    Sadie nodded. “Very wise. Who defends the defender?” She pushed the door open. It squalled on its hinges, loud and rusty.
    
    Lisa grunted. She was about to say that the only thing Sadie’d defended anyone from was a night of peaceful sleep. But then a noise from the depths froze the words in her throat.
    
    The scrape of stone.
    
    Followed by a thud.
    
    A sandpaper groan.
    
    There was actually somebody down there.
    
    ***
    
    “Sadie,” Lisa licked her lips, “Sadie, we should leave.” Lisa’s eyes were wide and wild. “I don’t like this, not one bit.”
    
    Sadie remained a statue, one hand on the door — which was now two-thirds of the way open. Her heart bounced from side to side in her ribcage. She reaffirmed her grip on the stake. “I, uh,” she cleared her throat, “I think there’s something in there. Like, something actually in there.”
    
    “Yeah? No shi—”
    
    Sadie raised a finger to her friend’s lips. “Shh!” Her eyes darted back and forth and she squinted. “I’m listening.”
    
    “Sadie, let’s call the cops and get outta here!” Lisa shuffled and pulled her phone out of her pocket. She swore. “Dead. This thing never holds its charge, any more! Lend me yours, Sade.”
    
    A hiccough in the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of her heart. “I left it at home.”
    
    “You what?”
    
    “Mum ‘n’ Dad keep trying to track my movements. So, I left it.”
    
    “Oh Jesus, Sade. Let’s go. Let’s go now.”
    
    “Shush, I said! I can hear something…”
    
    Lisa bit her tongue and held her breath. “I don’t—”
    
    “There.”
    
    A thud. A thump. The unmistakable sound of footsteps on stone.
    
    Sadie turned to face Lisa. Her gut plummeted into the ground. “It’s coming this way.”
    
    The colour drained from Lisa’s face. A small squeak escaped her pressed-together lips.
    
    Sadie grabbed her friend by the shoulders. “We’ve got to hide, Lis.”
    
    Lisa nodded and glanced around — a frightened rabbit in headlights. “Where, Sadie? Where?”
    
    “Behind the crypt, c’mon!”
    
    Sadie had to all but drag Lisa with her — further into the stone maze of the cemetery’s lifeless heart. They went past one, two, three rows of vaults and then hooked to the side. Sadie hunkered down and pulled Lisa down into a crouch, the eddies of fog now as high as their chests. To dip into that greyness was to plunge into ice. She pressed her finger to her lips and nodded. “Shh.”
    
    She braced against the rear of a tomb for balance and listened.
    
    Nothing.
    
    No thumps, thuds, slaps, taps, groans or growls.
    
    All was silent.
    
    Somewhere, an insect chirped. A bird cried out, and Lisa let out a little squeal. Sadie reached out and squeezed her hand.
    
    They waited. Sadie counted to a minute twice, and still, there was nothing. “Hey, Lis, you still with me?”
    
    The other girl nodded.
    
    “I think tha—”
    
    A hoarse moan rent the air, sliced her sentence in half.
    
    Lisa’s eyes bulged out of their sockets and she clamped her hands over her mouth. Gooseflesh prickled up all over Sadie’s body.
    
    “You need to get outta here.”
    
    Lisa nodded.
    
    “I’m gonna go see what it is.”
    
    Lisa gripped Sadie’s forearm in a claw, her nails dug into the skin. “Are you crazy? This isn’t a game Sadie — not anymore. Let’s just get the hell out of this place and pretend nothing ever happened, ‘kay?”
    
    “But there is something there.” Sadie’s eyes darkened as she broke free of Lisa’s grip and stood up. She clutched the stake to her chest. “And I’m gonna find out what it is.”
    
    “Are you insane? We need to go!”
    
    Sadie cast her eyes down to the ground. “I can’t,” she whispered. “We’ll be in high school next year, and these hunts…” Something swelled within her chest. “This year will be the last year we can do this. Properly. I don’t want to give it up, Lis. Not just yet.”
    
    “I’m not going to convince you to leave, am I?” The defeat in Lisa’s voice was tangible, but intermingled with it was something else. Pity? Love?
    
    She shook her head and said nothing. “But you can go. Really.” She nodded further into the crypts. “If you keep going, you’ll eventually come to the other side. The fence there isn’t too high, you should be able to climb it fairly easily. You can head home if you want. I’ll be fine. I’ll catch up with you tomorrow.”
    
    Lisa glanced in the direction Sade had directed. She hesitated for a moment, seemed to mull it over. She shook her head. “No way in hell I’m leaving you here alone.” She got to her feet — with some difficulty, due to how much she shook. “We’re the Bridgemoss Guardians,” she pulled a crucifix from her bag, “and we do things together.”
    
    ***
    
    They waited for 15 minutes until the figures had shuffled on by, hearts lodged in throats. The girls never got a good look at them, but it didn’t matter — their imaginations filled in the blanks.
    
    Once they were sure the horde had passed them, the pair made a break for the cemetery fence. Together, they scrambled up the wrought iron as laughter bubbled within them. Lisa had not felt this giddy in years. Adrenaline coursed through her veins. God, she felt so alive.
    
    As they stole down the other side of the fence, the midnight air rushed down her throat, sweet and cool. She and Sadie landed in synchronism, on all fours, as was the most fun way to do it.
    
    She cast one last glance at the cemetery before they sped off on Sadie’s ten-speed. Shadows and mysteries lurked in every crevice, nook and cranny. Excitement. Wonder.
    
    Magic.
    
    Who’d want to give that up? In exchange for drab adulthood?
    
    “We coming back tomorrow?” Lisa had to shout over the sound of the screaming wind.
    
    “Oh, hell yeah!” She could hear the smile in Sadie’s voice.
    
    “But we’re gonna need something more than stakes. I think those back there were zombies!”
    
    Sadie laughed as she pedalled with fury and the wind whipped their hair. “You’re learning fast, my protégé. Bridgemoss Guardians away!”`,
